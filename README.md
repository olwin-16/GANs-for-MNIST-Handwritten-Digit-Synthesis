# MNIST-Classification-using-GANs

This project demonstrates how to use a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for generating images and classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The GAN consists of a generator and a discriminator, where the generator creates realistic images, and the discriminator distinguishes between real and generated images.
