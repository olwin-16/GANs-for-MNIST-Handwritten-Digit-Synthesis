# MNIST-Classification-using-GANs

This project demonstrates how to use a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for generating images and classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The GAN consists of a generator and a discriminator, where the generator creates realistic images, and the discriminator distinguishes between real and generated images.

## Objectives
- To generate synthetic MNIST-like images using a GAN.
- To classify generated and real images with a classifier to demonstrate how well the GAN has learned to mimic the real data.
